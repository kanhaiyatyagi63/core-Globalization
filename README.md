## Cultures and Locales

The language needs to be associated with the particular region where it is spoken, and this is done by using locale (language + location). For example: fr is the code for French language. fr-FR means French language in France. So, fr specifies only the language whereas fr-FR is the locale. Similarly, fr-CA defines another locale implying French language and culture in Canada. If we use only fr, it implies a neutral culture (i.e., location neutral).
